<br>

I  listen to a lot of music and drink a lot
of good coffee. I love fashion, despite what people might think of
my own style. I recently got my nose pierced. I have a lot of thoughts and opinions to share with you; the most important one being that spiders have no place in the home. I don't claim to be an expert on anything and I am certainly not married to my ideas.

I currently develop at [Triage](https://triage.com), helping to end preventable deaths from skin cancer by making screening instant, affordable, and universally accessible.

Some interesting facts about me

* I consistently won the 50m sprint and long jump events in elementary school track meets
* I have held a conversation with Rob $tone
* I designed a t-shirt that is sold at Exile in Kensington Market
* I have come really close to a male moose during mating season
* I won the Gold Medal
